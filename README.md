# Algorithm

## Insertion Sort

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1. [2,27,16,22,18,6]
2. [2,6,16,22,18,27]
3. [2,6,16,18,22,27]

Big O Notation--->O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Time Complexity of this array is average case(For 18)

[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] 

1. [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
2. [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
3. [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
4. [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
5. [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,15,9]
6. [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15]

## Merge Sort 

[16,21,11,8,12,22] -> Merge Sort

1. [16,21,11] [8,12,22]
2. [16] [21,11]      [8,12] [22]
3. [16] [21] [11]     [8] [12] [22]
4. [16] [21,11]    [8,12]  [22]        
5. [11,16,21]    [8,12,22]
6. [8,11,16,21,22]

Big O Notation--->O(nlog<sub>n</sub>)

## Binary Search Tree
[7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2]

           [5]
      [2]         [8]
 [0][1] [3][4]   [7]
                [6][9]
